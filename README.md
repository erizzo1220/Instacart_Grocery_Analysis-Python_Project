# Instacart Grocery Analysis

## Project Summary

This project is an exploratory data analysis of Instacart’s sales data with the goal of uncovering key customer purchasing patterns. The project focuses on generating actionable insights to support data-driven marketing and advertising strategies.

The analysis addresses essential questions from the sales and marketing teams, including identifying peak ordering days and hours, evaluating customer spending behavior, and analyzing product demand across departments. It also explores customer segmentation by examining differences in purchasing behavior based on brand loyalty, region, age, income, and family status.

These insights help Instacart refine targeted marketing campaigns, improve promotional relevance, and drive increased customer engagement and sales.

## Key Questions

1. Which days of the week and times of day have the most orders?
2. At what times do customers spend the most money?
3. How can Instacart’s products be grouped into price ranges, and which ranges work best for marketing?
4. Which products and departments are the most popular?
5. How does a customer's loyalty level affect their ordering behavior?
6. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
7. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? (Age, Income, Certain types of goods, Family status, etc.)
